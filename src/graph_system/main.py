BRAIN STORM

In this folder system we want to start to figure out the different interactions we have in our graph
from ending action to action, none action to action and vice versa, also important to figure out what type of videos
we want to automate. For example, of we want summaries we can focus on giving more weight to equal timming between clips,
or if we want to give clip that flow nicely together clips that have similar area of focus compared to other

Steps:
First first out how to implement a graph structure that supports time and action

Second figure out more creative ways to get data from video processing and a way to effect the weighing of these factors

Third we need to refactor a lot of the code to work better
