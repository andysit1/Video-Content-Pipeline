This Stage handles the actual splicing of the video and is the most time consuming part of the program

  ideally if we ever find a better way of splicing videos it will go here. Probably a lot of min maxing memory and making sure
  we arent holding resources we dont need

  cuda/gpu rendering? idk we will figure that out later
